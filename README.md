# KISS Test Blocks

Scripts to autogenerate KISS calibration objects by bash script and passing on variables to OpenSCAD. OpenSCAD will then render and write out the stl objects. 

By varying the Seam Depth and Seam Gap, one can make the start and stop of the perimeter passes virtually disappear. 

In KISS slicer, print the test objects with the corresponding settings to correlate the variables.
